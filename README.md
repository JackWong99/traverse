# Traverse

Traverse is a GitHub explorer

#### What?

An Electron app in React + TypeScript, as close to fully tested as possible. It uses Webpack to bundle, Redux and Redux Saga for the store, and uses the GitHub REST API with the Axios rest client. We are using Jest/Chai + Enzyme as our test framework.
